### Research Statement
I study how policy interventions reshape beliefs and behavior, and how these changes propagate through markets to shape development and structural transformation. My work focuses on informational and behavioral frictions and on how interventions generate spillovers that affect untreated agents through local demand and network effects.

**At a glance**
- Fields: development economics, applied micro, political economy of policy
- Methods: large-scale field experiments, structural modeling
- Geography: Malawi, South Africa, Kenya
- Keywords: beliefs, spillovers, migration, general equilibrium, structural transformation

**Field experiments.** I design and implement large-scale experiments that measure direct effects and spillovers. In Malawi, I lead a collaboration with GiveDirectly involving a cash transfer program spanning approximately 120,000 participants and spatial variation in treatment intensity. Within this setting, I am implementing an information treatment that alerts firms to the upcoming demand shock generated by transfer-induced spillovers. This design will allow me to estimate how interventions reshape beliefs and behavior and how these changes propagate through local markets.

**Structural modeling.** I develop and estimate structural models that discipline these empirical patterns and clarify their implications for aggregate outcomes. Using nationally representative data and lab-in-field experiments, I calibrate key behavioral and informational frictions in models of growth, migration, and sectoral change. In ongoing work on South Africa, I study how perceived urban safety factors into rural-urban migration choice, with attention to implications for women's access to urban labor markets and for structural transformation more broadly.

Together, these approaches link causal identification to market-level outcomes and provide a coherent account of how policy interventions scale through general equilibrium channels.
