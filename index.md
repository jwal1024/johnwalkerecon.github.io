### Research Statement
I study how policy interventions reshape beliefs and behavior, and how these changes propagate through markets in general equilibrium to shape development and structural transformation. I pursue this agenda using two complementary approaches that link causal identification to market-level outcomes.

1) **Large-scale field experiments.** I design and implement experiments that measure direct effects and spillovers to untreated agents. In Malawi, I lead a collaboration with GiveDirectly involving a cash transfer program spanning approximately 120,000 participants and spatial variation in treatment intensity. Within this setting, I am implementing an information treatment that alerts firms to the upcoming demand shock generated by transfer-induced spillovers. This design enables precise estimation of how interventions reshape beliefs and behavior and how these changes propagate through local markets.

2) **Structural modeling.** I develop and estimate structural models that discipline these empirical patterns and clarify their implications for aggregate outcomes. Using nationally representative data and lab-in-field experiments, I calibrate key behavioral and informational frictions in models of growth, migration, and sectoral change. In ongoing work on South Africa, I study how perceived urban safety factors into rural-urban migration choice, with attention to implications for women's access to urban labor markets and for structural transformation more broadly.
