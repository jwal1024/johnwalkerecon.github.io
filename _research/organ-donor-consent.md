Cohort study of New South Wales donor referrals, 2010–2015. Of 2977 organ donor referrals, a similar proportion of families had consent for donation was sought between non-English speakers and English speakers (p = .07), and between overseas-born compared to Australian-born referrals (p = .3). However, consent was less likely to be given for both non-English speakers than English speakers (OR 0.44, 95%CI:0.29–0.67), and those overseas-born than Australian-born (OR 0.54, 95%CI:0.41–0.72). For referrals both overseas-born and non-English speaking, families were both less likely to be asked for consent (OR 0.67; 95%CI:0.49–0.91) or give consent (OR 0.24; 95%CI0.16–0.37). There was no difference in medical suitability between English speakers and non-English speakers (p = .6), or between Australian-born and overseas-born referrals (p = .6).
